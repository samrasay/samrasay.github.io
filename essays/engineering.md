## The Beginning ##
My journey to becoming a software engineer started with my passion for gaming.  As I'd go through a level of Crash Bandicoot or Super Mario 64, I would always think about how an entire world could exist within a CD or a game cartridge.  I dreamed of one day being able to create my own world within virtual space and allowing other people to explore my creation.  My passion for working with computers sparked from there, and I decided that I would go into the field of computer science.  However, it wasn't until my freshman year of college that I truly experienced programming.  I quickly realized that programming had so many uses and applications outside of making software and video games.  I felt that computer science had opened up a door for me, to explore all the different challenges that I can face using programming.

## The Journey ##
My passion for working with computers has allowed me to gain a solid understanding of how they work.  As a computer technician, I have been able to solve most issues with general troubleshooting, but I've always been left to wonder why the solution works.  So far, I have acquired a very basic tool set to start my journey to becoming a software engineer.  
Currently, I don't have much experience in programming outside of C, C++, and Java. I've worked on small projects like programming Arduino boards, but I've never worked on big projects such as web applications.  

## The Future ##
My plan for the future is to learn and develop the skills that are necessary to become a software engineer.  I look forward to developing programs and applications with team members and being able to share my thoughts and ideas.  I also aim to learn as much as I can about programming and the use of different technologies.  I hope that one day I will then be able to share my experience and knowledge with the next generation of software engineers.
