Working with technology is difficult.  At some point, you will encounter an error, a bug, or a failure that will force you to do a little research.  Thankfully, there are a vast amount of websites, forums, and discussion boards that can assist with providing an answer.  Although the tech community is filled with knowledgable individuals who are willing to help, you can very easily find yourself without a paddle.  If you wish to receive a well-thought out response, you must be able to ask a "smart" question.  In Eric Raymond's article, *How to ask questions the smart way*, he provides guidelines for effective interaction with the open source community:

*Before asking a technical question by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, do the following: Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to. Try to find an answer by searching the Web. Try to find an answer by reading the manual. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend. If youâ€™re a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.*
