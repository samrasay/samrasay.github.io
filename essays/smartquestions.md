Working with technology is difficult.  At some point, you will encounter an error, a bug, or a failure that will force you to do a little research.  Thankfully, there are a vast amount of websites, forums, and discussion boards that can assist with providing an answer.  Although the tech community is filled with knowledgable individuals who are willing to help, you can very easily find yourself without a paddle.  If you wish to receive a well-thought out response, you must be able to ask a "smart" question.  In Eric Raymond's article, *How to ask questions the smart way*, he provides guidelines for effective interaction with the open source community:

*Before asking a technical question by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, do the following: Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to. Try to find an answer by searching the Web. Try to find an answer by reading the manual. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend. If youâ€™re a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.*

Following these guidelines is important for anyone in a tech related field, because as a member of the tech community, everyone is held to a certain level of competency.  Asking questions that could have been solved by doing a little reading, will yield little to no results, because you have shown that you are unwilling to learn.  Nobody wants to help someone who's looking for the easy way out.  By constructing a well formulated question, and providing examples, it makes it much easier for others to provide you with a constructive response that resolves the issue and helps you understand the material.

## Smart Questions ##
As an example, here is what is considered to a "smart" question:
<img class="ui centered huge image" src="/images/smartquestion.png">

The question is short and simple, and the user describes his experiences with the issue.  The user provides examples of the methods he's used, by showing that he understands how to use `==` and `.equals()` when comparing strings.  By doing so, he has demonstrated that he has attempted to find an answer by experimentation.  Additionally, the user is not asking a question for the sake of an answer.  He is making an attempt to truly understand when to properly use `==` and `.equals()`, and leaves room for a strong discussion.
