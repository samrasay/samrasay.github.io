Configuration management is without a doubt one of the most important software engineering skills.  Building complex software systems requires a tremendous amount of effort and coordination.  Teams who work together must be able to organize their thoughts and ideas efficiently, otherwise their project may result in failure.  Configuration management is truly a blessing, and is the core of software development.

Git and GitHub are tools that have proven to be effective when it comes to configuration management.  When others are trying to manipulate code that you have already written, it can get pretty messy.  In the past, teams that I've worked in have almost always run into issues with configuration management, due to stepping on each other's toes.  Had I discovered GitHub, those projects would have been completed in a shorter amount of time, and caused fewer headaches.

I don't believe Git or GitHub are popular because of one or the other.  I believe that they both played an equal part in creating an effective means of configuration management.  If one did not exist, there would still be other means of configuration management, but they wouldn't be as complete as the Git and GitHub combo.  I look forward to using Git and GitHub in future projects, and hope that I can use them as tools to create meaningful projects.
