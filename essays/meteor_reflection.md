## Getting Ready for Blast Off ##
Lately, I've been learning the building blocks for using Meteor to build an application.  It's been a bumpy road filled with much rage and frustration along with excitement and curiosity.  Installing Meteor and becoming familiar with how it worked was quite the challenge at first.  However, after building up my knowledge with a few practice projects, I have grasped a better understanding of how to efficiently use the tools it offers.  It's definitely sparked my interest in wanting to create bigger, more complex projects.  I feel that my horizon has been expanded by learning how to use Meteor.
