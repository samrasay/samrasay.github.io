## Getting Ready for Blast Off ##

Lately, I've been learning the building blocks for using Meteor to build an application.  It's been a bumpy road filled with much rage and frustration along with excitement and curiosity.  I'll admit that I was overwhelmed with putting together the concept of client-side code, server-side code, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. all together to make one application.  As a full-stacked JavaScript framework, it was intimidating to dive straight in.  However, after getting my feet wet, I found that Meteor can be quite friendly to beginners and an extremely useful tool for experts. 

## One Small Step for Software Engineering ##
Installing Meteor and becoming familiar with how it worked was quite the challenge at first.  However, I built up my knowledge with a few practice projects.  It was difficult to understand spacebars, templates, and helpers and how they all interacted with one another. I found myself asking questions such as "how do I route my home page to this page?" and "how do I allow the user to update this table, and change it on the server?".  As a beginner, I tried to soak up as much information as I could building practice applications via tutorials. Eventually, I grasped a better understanding of how to efficiently use the tools it offers and it has sparked my interest in wanting to create bigger, more complex projects.  I feel that my horizon has been expanded by learning how to use Meteor.

## Houston, we have several problems... ##
I would definitely say that there is a steep learning curve for Meteor.  You're only limited to how far you want to go with your application, and how much you actually want to know; which can also be said about a lot of things.  I was intimidated by Meteor at first because I had very limited knowledge of building client-server applications or their architecture.  If it hadn't been for those practice tutorials, I most likely would have given up learning Meteor and tried to move on to something new or simpler.

One of the biggest frustrations with Meteor that I had, was building new applications.  Creating a new repository and setting up a new application for the first time eats up a tremendous amount of time.  Although you could use the time to take a break, drink some coffee, or do some reading, it would be nice to be able to immediately get started on building your application.  Waiting for Meteor to finish running ```meteor npm run start``` in Terminal or Command Prompt is such a hassle, and the fact that the progress bar is practically useless makes it even worse!

## My Astronomical Experience ##
Overall, I've had a positive experience working with Meteor.  It's definitely helped simplified the idea of building web applications for me.  Now that I have a better understanding of application architecture, I feel more confident in my skills to work with others and build more complex projects in the future.
