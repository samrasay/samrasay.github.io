## Getting Ready for Blast Off ##
Lately, I've been learning the building blocks for using Meteor to build an application.  It's been a bumpy road filled with much rage and frustration along with excitement and curiosity.  Installing Meteor and becoming familiar with how it worked was quite the challenge at first.  However, after building up my knowledge with a few practice projects, I have grasped a better understanding of how to efficiently use the tools it offers.  It's definitely sparked my interest in wanting to create bigger, more complex projects.  I feel that my horizon has been expanded by learning how to use Meteor.

## One Small Step for Software Engineering ##
I would definitely say that there is a steep learning curve for Meteor.  You're only limited to how far you want to go with your application, and how much you actually want to know; which can also be said about a lot of things.  I was intimidated by Meteor at first because I had very limited knowledge of building client-server applications or their architecture.  Yet, once I started getting my hands dirty by working through step-by-step tutorials, I began to understand that it wasn't all too bad.  Meteor allowed me to use languages I was familiar with, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a web applications that was fully functional.  Although the tutorials I went through had functions and keywords I was unfamiliar with, I found myself being able to grasp the concept of what a web application looks like.

## My Astronomical Experience ##
Overall, I've had a positive experience working with Meteor.  It's definitely helped simplified the idea of building web applications for me.  Now that I have a better understanding of application architecture, I feel more confident in my skills to work with others and build more complex projects in the future.
