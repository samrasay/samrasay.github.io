## Work Smarter not Harder ##

Websites serve the purpose of allowing a user to interact online in a simple and efficient manner.  HTML and CSS are great languages to create visually appealing websites, but the amount of raw HTML and CSS needed to accomplish this feat can become quite messy; that's where frameworks come in.  Frameworks can be quite difficult to manage at first, but dedicating time to learning the library and syntax pays off and the results are outstanding!

## Speaking the Same Language ##

Recently, I've been working with Semantic UI, a framework for HTML and CSS.  The beauty behind Semantic UI is the library filled with premade classes that allow websites to be created effortlessly.  Because these classes are based off of common features used by websites today, it's very simple to create a professional website with modern-day appeal.  Additionally, the classes are defined to create exactly what you want.  For example, if you wanted to make a big blue button, you would simply specify:

`<div class = "big blue button">Button</div>`

And you end up with: <img class="ui medium right floated image" src="/images/button.png">

## IntelliJ and ESLint ##
Using IntelliJ and ESLint has made programming in JavaScript that much easier.  JSFiddle is great, but not having a tool to check your syntax can make life difficult when writing code.  Although I appreciate the utility provided by ESLint, I have mixed feelings about its coding standards.  It flags you on every little detail, down to whether or not there is a space between the curly brace and the end of a parameter's closing parenthesis when creating a function.  I love that it makes writing code with others much easier, it strips away my freedom to write clean code the way I want to.  It is definitely not worth my time working to get that green checkmark, when I know that my code is written well enough to read.

## The Bottom Line ##
I believe that good coding standards lies within writing simple, effective, code that can be read easily by others.  It forces you to think thoroughly of how your code works, and how you can improve it so that others can work with it.  Additionally, I believe that development tools such as IntelliJ and ESLint are great but, I think they hand-hold too much, and could ease up a little on correcting every little mistake.
