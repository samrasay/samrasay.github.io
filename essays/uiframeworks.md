## Work Smarter not Harder ##

Websites serve the purpose of allowing a user to interact online in a simple and efficient manner.  HTML and CSS are great languages to create visually appealing websites, but the amount of raw HTML and CSS needed to accomplish this feat can become quite messy; that's where frameworks come in.  Frameworks can be quite difficult to manage at first, but dedicating time to learning the library and syntax pays off and the results are outstanding!

## Speaking the Same Language ##
Recently, I've been working with Semantic UI, a framework for HTML and CSS.  The beauty behind Semantic UI is the library filled with premade classes that allow websites to be created effortlessly.  Because these classes are based off of common features used by websites today, it's very simple to create a professional website with modern-day appeal.  Additionally, the classes are defined to create exactly what you want.  For example, if you wanted to make a big blue button, you would simply specify:

`'<div class = "big blue button">Button</div>'`

And you end up with: 

<img class="ui small image" src="/images/button.png">

The syntax and class names of Semnatic UI practically allow you to write HTML and CSS in English!  It saves the pain of specifying and creating several different classes in your CSS stylesheet; along with the trouble of having to edit and correct those classes if you manage to mess up (which will happen more often than not).

## Do You Have a Minute? ##
Learning a new framework can almost be equivalent to learning a new programming language.  There's no doubt that frustration will occur when working with a tool that you do not know how to use.  In any case, a large amount of time must be invested into understanding the framework to spare yourself the pains and headaches of trying to get it to work properly.  Watching tutorials and looking at examples from websites such as PluralSight, definitely helped me grasp a better understanding of Semantic UI.  Devoting time to learning a framework definitely pays off and puts you at an advantage when it comes to developing a beautiful web page.

## Building a Solid Foundation ##

Although I have never worked with a framework before, I have newfound praise for them.  Frameworks allow you to build a beautiful house fitted with windows, doors, and shutters; rather than putting up four walls and a roof and calling it a "home".  After acquainting myself with Semantic UI by rebuilding several other websites, it's safe to say that it definitely speeds up the process and efficiency of web development.  The days of writing raw HTML and CSS are over for me, and I intend on utilizing Semantic UI to the fullest when developing my own websites in the future.
