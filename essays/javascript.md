The first time I was exposed to code was as a junior in high school.  My math teacher knew that I was interested in computer science, but was well aware that the school did not offer those courses.  He offered to teach me the basics of C++ so that we could develop a small game that all the other students could play.  The game was unfinished because of time constraints and priorities, but I was able to continue my passion for coding when I got to college where I learned more about C, C++, and Java.

As I learn more about Javascript, I find it neat that it uses some of the same syntax as the languages I already know, which makes it simple to understand.  Alongside that, it also eliminates the struggle of having to declare variable types, and saves you time on being able to know what kind of variable you're declaring.  I don't know much about what I'll be capable of with knowing this language, but I aspire to be able to accomplish big projects once I gain a deeper understanding.  Since Javascript is a language that is widely used, I aim to know it inside and out in order to be successful in the future.  Through FreeCodeCamp I went through several exercises to learn the basics of Javascript. The excercises were mostly based on skills that were similar to what I already had developed learning C++ and Java, but there were a few tricks with Javascript that Java or C++ can't do.

Athletic software engineering is a very interesting way of learning this material.  I find the practice WODs extremely useful because it applies the same concept of practicing for any other sport.  I can improve my finishing time by repeating the practice WOD, the same way a sprinter would try to improve his 40-year dash.  Although it's a race against the clock, I enjoy being able to compete against other people in the class to see who's faster.  I believe competition is healthy in a learning environment, and allows people to push themselves for growth.  The pressure of having a time constraint also helps build a solid foundation for the professional world, where you may just be asked to write code on the spot for a job interview.

I believe that this module on Javascript basics is a good learning point or even refreshing point for new and intermediate students. Additionally, WODs seem like they are doable as long as I engage myself in the experiential learning and keep practicing and refining my skills daily. It's better to practice a little bit every day rather than practice all in one day, or not even practice at all.
