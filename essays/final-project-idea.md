## Overview ##
The problem: There are many bright minds on campus that are working on projects in many different fields.  However, finding help for working on these projects is not always an easy task.  So, how would you be able to find those people who are interested in contributing?

The solution: Project Hub would enable users to log in to create and sign up to assist others with projects that they're interested to work on.  Users would be able to determine which projects they're interested in by:

- Major
- Organization/Club
- Interests

Each project would have an "owner" who would post a request for students to join, and that project would have to be approved by an "admin".  Admins would be in charge of ensuring that the projects are active, to avoid students from joining a project that is either complete or no longer available.

## Mockup Page Ideas##
Some mockup pages include:

- Public landing page
- Login page
- User home page
- Project owner page
- Admin page
- Projects listing page
- Browse projects by interests/organization/major page(s)
