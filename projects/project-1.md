The ROV competition held by the Marine Advanced Technology Education Center is a program that that challenges students to apply the physics, math, electronics, and engineering skills they are learning in the classroom to solving problems from the marine workplace.  Events are held worldwide, and each year, the challenges that the students must face are changed every year.  Students are only limited by safety restrictions and are open to use any materials, skills, and assets they have acquired.  Students are challenged to think of themselves as a business, and must also create a professional persona for their company.  Alongside developing an underwater ROV, they must also produce a technical report, poster display board, and business presentation.

For this project, I was the lead technical writer who was responsible for design of the technical report, poster display board, and business presentation.  I was also responsible for creating the professional image of the company, and designed the logo.  Throughout the year, I gathered and compiled the necessary information to include in the technical report.  This consisted of design rationale, graphs, budget sheets, and team evaluations.  The same data was then used to design the poster display board, which quickly summarized the design rationale and goals of the company.  For the business presentation, I was responsible for creating speech content and teaching team members the necessary skills to create a formal 15 minute presentation.
