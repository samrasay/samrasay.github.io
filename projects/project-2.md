The Kailua High School Robotics Program originally started as an afterschool club that was formed by me and my friends during our junior and senior year of high school.  The goal of the program is to build an underwater robot capable of competing in the MATE ROV competition.  During my time on the team, we received numerous awards including 4th and 5th place at the 2012 and 2013 International MATE ROV Competition.

I am currently a mentor for the program, and teach students the basic concepts of building an underwater robot and building a business.  Students learn and apply many of the skills they would learn in STEM courses, but also develop technical skills such as technical writing and public speaking.  They are challenged every day to find solutions to new problems and situations.
