summary: Video editing for ITS Talks.
---

ITS Talks is a series of presentations done by guest speakers every Wednesday on different subjects.  These talks are similar to TEDx talks, and can be done on anything the speaker desires.  There have been presentations on network security, rock climbing, and even cosplay.  The presentations are held in the conference room of the ITS building and are recorded for those who are unable to attend.

I take the recorded videos and edit them to eliminate unwanted background noise, add color correction, or graphics.  It's a challenge, due to the fact that the camera and microphone quality aren't always the greatest.  This allows me to think of new ways to get creative, and either develop new techniques or improvise to get the results that I want.
